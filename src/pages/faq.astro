                Made by and for people living with complex trauma, Process is an AI tool trained on EMDR, IFS, and somatic therapeutic principles. Unlike generic mental health apps that focus on general anxiety or depression, we address the emotional dysregulation and other challenges specific to complex trauma. Our AI guides you in understanding how you feel, and giving yourself the unconditional love and care you need, responding with trauma-informed care rather than generic "just breathe" advice or therapy-speak.
