# AI Policy

**Last updated: July 2, 2025**

## Introduction

Process uses artificial intelligence to provide trauma-informed emotional support and insights. This AI Policy explains how our AI systems work, their limitations, and how we ensure they align with trauma-informed care principles.

**Our AI is designed to be a supportive tool, not a replacement for human connection or professional mental health care.**

## Our AI Technology

### Core AI System
**Anthropic Claude AI:**
- Powers our conversational AI for trauma-informed emotional processing
- Trained on trauma-informed therapeutic frameworks including EMDR, IFS, and somatic principles
- Designed to recognize and respond appropriately to complex trauma presentations
- Continuously updated with latest trauma research and best practices

### Voice Technology
**ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech:**
- Converts our AI's text responses into natural-sounding speech
- Provides voice interaction options for accessibility and comfort
- Used only when you choose voice features
- Does not analyze or store your voice patterns

### Additional AI Components
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies emotional triggers and themes in your conversations
- **Crisis Detection**: Monitors for language indicating potential self-harm or crisis
- **Personalization**: Adapts responses based on your interaction history and preferences

## How Our AI Is Trained

### Trauma-Informed Training
Our AI systems are specifically configured for complex trauma support through:

**Therapeutic Framework Integration:**
- EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) principles
- IFS (Internal Family Systems) approaches to parts work
- Somatic experiencing and body-based trauma awareness
- Attachment theory and developmental trauma understanding

**Safety-First Programming:**
- Recognition of dissociation, hypervigilance, and emotional flooding
- Appropriate responses to trauma triggers and flashbacks
- Understanding of complex trauma vs. single-incident PTSD
- Cultural trauma awareness and sensitivity

**Content Safeguards:**
- Avoidance of potentially triggering language or suggestions
- Recognition when professional intervention may be needed
- Appropriate boundary setting and limit recognition

### Training Data and Privacy
**What We Use:**
- Anonymized, aggregated conversation patterns (no personal information)
- Published trauma research and therapeutic literature
- Best practices from trauma-informed care guidelines
- Feedback from trauma specialists and survivors

**What We Don't Use:**
- Your personal conversations are NEVER used for AI training
- No personally identifiable information in training datasets
- No sharing of individual user data with AI providers
- No real-time learning from your specific interactions

- Honest acknowledgment when AI doesn't understand
- Regular reminders about the supportive (not therapeutic) nature of interactions
- Open about when human professional support is recommended

### Bias Prevention and Fairness

**Ongoing Monitoring:**
- Regular audits for harmful or inappropriate responses
- Testing across diverse trauma presentations and backgrounds
- Feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Trauma specialist oversight of AI development

**Inclusive Design:**
- Recognition of diverse trauma experiences (racial, gender, sexual orientation, cultural)
- Awareness of different communication styles and preferences

- Sensitivity to various trauma types and severities

## Data Use and AI Improvement

### How We Improve Our AI

**Aggregated Learning:**
- Analysis of anonymized conversation patterns
- Identification of common trauma themes and effective responses
- Research collaboration with trauma specialists
- Continuous updates based on latest trauma research

**Quality Assurance:**
- Regular review of AI responses by trauma-informed professionals
- Testing with diverse user scenarios and trauma presentations
- Feedback integration from mental health experts
- User satisfaction and safety monitoring

### Your Role in AI Improvement

**Feedback Opportunities:**
- Rate AI responses for helpfulness and appropriateness
- Report concerning or inappropriate AI behavior
- Suggest improvements through in-app feedback
- Participate in optional research surveys

**Privacy Protection:**
- All feedback is anonymized before analysis
- No personal information is shared in improvement processes
- You can opt out of contributing to AI improvement at any time
- Individual conversations remain private regardless of feedback

## AI Transparency and Explainability

### Understanding AI Responses

**Response Generation:**
- AI responses are generated based on trauma-informed training and your current input
- The AI considers conversation context but doesn't store personal details
- Responses aim to be helpful, but may not always be perfect or applicable
- AI cannot provide personalized medical or psychological advice

**Pattern Recognition Insights:**
- AI-identified patterns are suggestions, not clinical assessments
- Insights are based on conversation content you've shared
- Patterns may help with self-awareness but don't constitute diagnosis
- Always consider patterns within your broader life context

### When AI Doesn't Work Well

**Limitations to Expect:**
- AI may occasionally misunderstand your intent or emotional state
- Responses may sometimes feel generic or not quite right
- AI cannot fully understand complex human emotions and experiences
- Technical issues may affect AI performance

**What to Do:**
- Feel free to clarify or rephrase your input
- Let us know if AI responses seem inappropriate or unhelpful
- Remember that AI is a tool to supplement, not replace, human support
- Seek human connection when AI support feels insufficient

## Crisis Detection and Response

### How We Monitor for Crisis

**Automated Detection:**
- AI monitors for language indicating potential self-harm or suicide risk
- Recognition of crisis-level emotional distress
- Identification of emergency situations requiring immediate attention

**Response Protocol:**
- Immediate provision of crisis resources and helpline numbers
- Gentle guidance toward appropriate emergency services
- Clear communication about AI limitations in crisis situations
- Documentation of crisis interactions for safety follow-up

### Your Safety Rights
